/**
 * Implementation of a hash table that stores key-value
 * pairs mapping unsigned integers to instances of
 * ValueType.
 *
 * Hash function: key % tableSize
 * Collision resolution: quadratic probing.
 * Non-unique keys are not supported.
 *
 * Any use of the term "element" refers to a key-value pair.
 *
 * Some functions have runtime requirements.
 * During lecture, I mentioned that when talking about hash
 * tables, people tend to talk as if common hash table
 * operations take constant time, even though this is false.
 * Here, any mention of "constant time" in double quotes means
 * "amortized constant time on average", i.e. you should
 * use hashing to speed things up and not iterate through
 * all the buckets, ignoring the hash function. For instance,
 * it is required that you implement delete() in "constant
 * time", so you cannot take the inefficient approach of
 * searching for the relevant key by iterating 
 * bucket-by-bucket.
 *
 * The table rehashes whenever the insertion of a new
 * element would put the load factor at at least 1/2.
 * (The rehashing is done before the element would've been inserted.)
 * Upon a rehash, the table size (let's call it m) should
 * be increased to the lowest prime number that is greater
 * than or equal to 2m. Elements are then transferred
 * from the "old table" to the "new/larger table" in the
 * order in which they appear in the old table, and then
 * the new element is finally inserted.
